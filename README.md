# DataAnalysis
#### Author: Naveen
In this SQL Project for Data Analysis, I'll will efficiently leverage various analytical features and functions accessible through SQL in PostgreSQL.

## Primary Objective of the project
The primary objective involves analyzing the data using **SQL** on the **PostgreSQL**. First, we download **PostgreSQL** from its official website and analyze the issue.  Then we set up a password for teh "postgres" username during the software installiation. Further, SQL Plus is used to connect to **pgadmin** using the same credentials of the PostgreSQL.

## Todo:
Observing relationships between tables, browsing the columns, and noticing the comments. Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values, and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc. Then working on Data Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis. Further taking Backup of the Table where migration is occurring and use COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands. Then listing down distinct records, further renaming columns, and finally, listing down employee details based on the complex nested conditions.
